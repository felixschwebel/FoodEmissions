# FoodEmissions
Data Analysis of the Green-House-Gas Emissions of Food Products using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib** and **Plotly**.

<br></br>
In my analysis I started comparing the GHG Emissions of different products and product categories, e.g. processed vs. unprocessed and animal vs. plant products.

Then I wanted to now which factor contributed the most to the GHG Emissions for each product:

**What deos this mean for the consumption of beef and dark chocolate?**
<br></br>
The products with the lowest Total GHG Emissions are Root Vegetables, Apples, Citrus Fruit and Nuts with around 0,5 per kg. Dark Chocolate and Beef have the highest Total GHG Emissions.
<br></br>
The Total GHG Emissions of Dark Chocolate are nearly 94-times as high as the Emissions of the products with the lowest Emissions. Most of the Emissions come from the Land Use Change. Beef has similar Land Use Change as Dark Chocolate, but the Farming Emissions are 10-times as high. This makes Beef the product with the highest Total GHG Emissions (at least in this dataset), twice as high as the Emissions from Dark Chocolate and nearly 200-times as high as the Emissions from Vegetables, Citrus Fruit and Nuts.
